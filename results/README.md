# Results Directory

This directory stores all the outputs generated by the KORA pipeline, including trained model weights, extracted Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), benchmark results, and visualizations.

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `{accession}/` | Each cohort's results are stored in a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `GSE12345/`). |
| `{accession}/weights/` | Contains the `trained_weights.npy` (Numpy array of learned synaptic weights) and `gene_names.json` (list of gene symbols used). |
| `{accession}/grn/` | Stores the extracted Gene Regulatory Network for the cohort: `adjacency.csv` (full matrix) and `edges.tsv` (list of significant regulatory edges). |
| `{accession}/logs/` | Training logs and statistics in JSON format. |
| `benchmarks/` | Contains benchmark logs (`.log`) and structured data (`.csv`) comparing CPU and NPU inference performance. |
| `visualizations/` | Generated plots and interactive HTML/GIFs from the analysis phase. |
| `figures/` | Placeholder for final publication-quality figures. |
| `tables/` | Placeholder for final summary tables. |

## Manifest

*   **`{accession}/weights/trained_weights.npy`**: NumPy array representing the final synaptic weights of the trained SNN.
*   **`{accession}/weights/gene_names.json`**: JSON file listing the gene symbols corresponding to the SNN neurons.
*   **`{accession}/grn/adjacency.csv`**: CSV file of the full gene-by-gene adjacency matrix for the extracted GRN.
*   **`{accession}/grn/edges.tsv`**: TSV file listing the significant regulatory edges, their weights, and inferred type (activation/repression).
*   **`{accession}/logs/training_stats.json`**: JSON file containing summary statistics from the SNN training process.
*   **`benchmarks/benchmark_{accession}.log`**: Raw log output from Swift benchmark runs.
*   **`benchmarks/benchmark_{accession}.csv`**: Parsed CSV of benchmark results for a cohort (throughput, latency).
*   **`visualizations/benchmark_performance.png`**: Bar chart comparing CPU vs NPU throughput.
*   **`visualizations/weight_distributions.png`**: Violin plot showing weight distributions across cohorts.
*   **`visualizations/grn_topology.png`**: Grid of top GRN interactions.
*   **`visualizations/grn_interactive_{accession}.html`**: Interactive 3D GRN visualization for a selected cohort.
*   **`visualizations/weight_scan_{accession}.gif`**: Animation of weight threshold scanning.

## Notes

*   This directory is typically regenerated by the pipeline scripts.
*   All contents of this directory are ignored by git (`.gitignore`) due to their size and transient nature.
