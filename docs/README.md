# Documentation

This directory contains various documentation files pertaining to the KORA project, its pipeline, design decisions, and status reports.

## Overview

KORA (Kinetic Ordered Regulatory Analysis) is a novel neuroscientific pipeline for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from transcriptomic data using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and generalized Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, methodologies, and specific implementations.
